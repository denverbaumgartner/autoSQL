## Understanding AST

An AST is a tree representation of the syntactic structure of source code in programming languages. Each node of the tree denotes a construct occurring in the source code. In the context of SQL, it would represent the structure of a SQL query.

Now let's delve into the AST structure for SQL:

1. **Root Node**:
   - The root node represents the entire SQL statement.

2. **Statement Nodes**:
   - These nodes represent individual SQL statements such as `CREATE`, `SELECT`, `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, or `DELETE`. Depending on your AST structure, this might be at the root level or a level below it.

3. **Clause Nodes**:
   - These nodes represent various clauses in SQL statements such as `WHERE`, `FROM`, `GROUP BY`, `ORDER BY`, and `HAVING`.

4. **Expression Nodes**:
   - These nodes represent expressions which can be arithmetic operations, comparisons, function calls, etc.

5. **Literal Nodes**:
   - These nodes represent literals such as strings, numbers, booleans, etc.

6. **Identifier Nodes**:
   - These nodes represent identifiers like column names, table names, aliases, etc.

Here's a simple visualization of an AST structure for a basic SQL query (`SELECT age FROM users WHERE age > 25`):

```plaintext
            [ROOT]
              |
          [SELECT]
           /    \
       [FROM]  [WHERE]
        /         \
    [USERS]     [EXPRESSION]
                   /      \
               [AGE]   [LITERAL: 25]
                   \
                 [OPERATOR: >]
```

In this tree:

- **[ROOT]**: Represents the entire query.
- **[SELECT]**: Represents the SELECT statement.
- **[FROM]**: Represents the FROM clause, with "users" as the table name.
- **[WHERE]**: Represents the WHERE clause.
- **[EXPRESSION]**: Represents the comparison expression.
- **[AGE]**: Represents the column name involved in the comparison.
- **[LITERAL: 25]**: Represents the value being compared against.
- **[OPERATOR: >]**: Represents the comparison operator.
