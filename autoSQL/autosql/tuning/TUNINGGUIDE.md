### Tuning Terms

`train_epoch_loss`: Represents the average loss over the entire training dataset for a single epoch.
It's computed by taking the average of the loss values from each mini-batch or iteration during training.
This metric gives you an idea of how well the model is fitting the training data.

`eval_epoch_loss`: Represents the average loss over the entire evaluation (or validation) dataset for a single epoch.
It's computed by evaluating the model on the validation data after the completion of each training epoch, then averaging the loss values from each mini-batch or iteration of the evaluation.
This metric gives you an idea of how well the model generalizes to unseen data.

### How to gauge them:

`Absolute Value`: In isolation, the absolute value of the loss might not mean much unless you have a baseline or reference to compare against. For instance, a loss value of 0.5 might be good for one problem but terrible for another.

`Trends over Epochs`: What's more important is the trend of the loss values over epochs.
If train_epoch_loss consistently decreases, it indicates the model is learning.
If eval_epoch_loss starts to increase while train_epoch_loss continues to decrease, it may indicate overfitting. This means the model is memorizing the training data at the expense of its ability to generalize.

`Comparison between Training and Evaluation Loss`: Ideally, both train_epoch_loss and eval_epoch_loss should decrease over time and be close in value. A significant gap between them can indicate overfitting.

`Early Stopping`: If eval_epoch_loss stops decreasing (or increases for a certain number of epochs), you might want to stop training. This technique is called early stopping and is used to prevent overfitting.

`Plateau or Convergence`: If both losses plateau and don't change much over several epochs, the model might have reached convergence, meaning further training might not lead to significant improvements.

`Comparing with Baseline Models`: It's beneficial to have a simple baseline model. If a complex model doesn't perform significantly better than a simple model, it might not be the right architecture or there might be issues with the training data.

`Domain-specific Benchmarks`: Depending on the problem domain (e.g., image classification, machine translation), there might be established benchmarks. Comparing your loss values against these benchmarks can give you an idea of where your model stands.
